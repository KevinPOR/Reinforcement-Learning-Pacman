Just run all the cells in order in each python notebook.
You might need to change the paths where the videos and the models should be saved.
Method 1 and the Random notebooks were done on google collab. To train more in method 1 I had to use local PC and method 2 was only done locally as colab's RAM resources are limited for the free version.
